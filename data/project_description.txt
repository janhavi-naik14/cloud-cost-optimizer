I want to build a real-time data analytics platform for startups to monitor user activity and performance metrics. The frontend may use React or Vue, while the backend can be built using Node.js or Python (FastAPI). Data could be stored in PostgreSQL or MongoDB, and the system will be hosted on AWS or Azure with Nginx or a managed load balancer. The application should be scalable, secure, and highly available, with an estimated monthly cloud budget of 5000 INR.
